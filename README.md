Psymmetry 2.1
=========
In its present form a Psymmetry 2.1 software works with 1-bit bmp images in which black pixels represent an object and white pixels are background. You can start from using test image provided (test.bmp). The software is initiated by pressing ‘Run’ button located in the lower left-hand side of the window. Pressing the button opens a dialog, the mask preventing a user from seeing any file except bmp one. In case if a user tries to open either 8-bit or 24-bit image file, then the message ‘No object pixels, check whether you use 1-bit image’ appears on the lower panel. File opening starts the analysis. The software draws (from left to right) the initial binary mask of an object, array of radial-asymmetric pixels and array of point-asymmetric pixels. The centroid and borderline pixels (used to calculate perimeter) of an object are drawn in red. Values for several parameters will be shown on the lower panel of the window and simultaneously written into the text file (data.txt) placed in the same folder from which an analyzed image file is read. These parameters include: Area (in pixels), Perimeter (in pixels), Proportion of radial-asymmetric pixels (in percents), Proportion of point-asymmetric pixels (in percents) and Shape Factor (SF). SF was calculated by the formula: SF = (Perimeter*Perimeter)/(4Pi *Area).
